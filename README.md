# init.lua

My personal neovim configuration, highly inspired by ThePrimeagen's and TeejDv's
configurations.

## LSP servers

I manage all my LSP servers using NixOS

## TODO

- [ ] Go through shortcuts
- [ ] LSP telescope function check, DAP shortcuts check
- [ ] print in config not really works (at least in telekasten.lua on startup).
Need to use some notification systems, vim.notify?
- [ ] review and maybe integrate some changes from these articles:
